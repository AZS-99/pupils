The Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the calculations used by doctors to assess an adult’s health. The doctor measures
the patient’s height (in metres) and weight (in kilograms), then calculates the BMI using the formula

                                            BMI = weight / (height * height)

Write a program which prompts for the patient’s height and weight, calculates the BMI, and dis- plays the corresponding
message from the table below.
