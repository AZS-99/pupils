Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. Therefore, the monthly
interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes
          100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
After the second month, the value in the account becomes
          (100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252
After the third month, the value in the account becomes
          (100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507
and so on.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a monthly saving amount and displays the account value after the sixth
month. Here is a sample run of the program:
Enter the monthly saving amount: 100
After the sixth month, the account value is 608.81
