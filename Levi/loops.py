Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%. Therefore, the monthly
interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417. After the first month, the value in the account becomes
          100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417
After the second month, the value in the account becomes

After the third month, the value in the account becomes
