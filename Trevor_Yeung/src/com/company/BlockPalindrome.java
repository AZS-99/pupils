/*
A palindrome is a word that shows the same sequence of letters when reversed. If a word can have its letters grouped
together in two or more blocks (each containing one or more adjacent letters) then it is a block palindrome if reversing
the order of those blocks results in the same sequence of blocks.

For example, using brackets to indicate blocks, the following are block palindromes:
• BONBON can be grouped together as (BON)(BON);
• ONION can be grouped together as (ON)(I)(ON);
• BBACBB can be grouped together as (B)(BACB)(B) or (BB)(AC)(BB) or (B)(B)(AC)(B)(B)
Note that (BB)(AC)(B)(B) is not valid as the reverse (B)(B)(AC)(BB) shows the blocks in a different order.

Sample Run:
BBACBB
3

ONION
1
