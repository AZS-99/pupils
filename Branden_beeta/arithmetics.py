One death every 13 seconds
One new immigrant every 45 seconds
Write a program to display the population for the next five years. Assume the current population is 312032486

Write a program that reads a Celsius degree from the console and converts it to Fahrenheit and displays the result.
The formula for the conversion is as follows:
                                fahrenheit = (9 / 5) x celsius + 32

Sample Run:
Enter a degree in Celsius: 43

Sample output:
43 Celsius is 109.4 Fahrenheit

Write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final
temperatures of the water. The formula to compute the energy is
                        Q = M x (finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature) x 4184
where M is the weight of water in kilograms, temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and energy Q is measured in joules.
Here is a sample run:

Enter the amount of water in kilograms: 55.5
Enter the initial temperature: 3.5
Enter the final temperature: 10.5
The energy needed is 1625484.0

Write a program that reads in an investment amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years, and displays the
future investment value using the following formula:

For example, if you enter the amount 1000, an annual interest rate of 4.25%, and the number of years as 1, the future
investment value is 1043.33. Here is a sample run:

Enter investment amount: 1000
